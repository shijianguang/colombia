Finally, a brief overview of the WebSIFT system as an example of a prototypical Web usage mining system is given.\"},\"Sources\":[{\"Url\":\"http:\\\/\\\/www.ischool.utexas.edu\\\/~i385e\\\/readings\\\/srivatta.pdf\"}]},{\"Id\":1501500081,\"Title\":{\"OriginalTitle\":\"A Survey of Clustering Data Mining Techniques\",\"NormalizedTitle\":\"A Survey of Clustering Data Mining Techniques\"},\"PublishYear\":2006,\"Authors\":[{\"Id\":2062427917,\"Name\":\"Pavel Berkhin\"}],\"Affiliations\":[{\"Id\":1325784139,\"Name\":\"Yahoo\"}],\"FieldsOfStudies\":[{\"Id\":119857082,\"Name\":\"Machine learning\"},{\"Id\":48753275,\"Name\":\"Numerical analysis\"},{\"Id\":207968372,\"Name\":\"k-means clustering\"},{\"Id\":92835128,\"Name\":\"Hierarchical clustering\"},{\"Id\":120894424,\"Name\":\"Exploratory data analysis\"},{\"Id\":8038995,\"Name\":\"Unsupervised learning\"},{\"Id\":124101348,\"Name\":\"Data mining\"}],\"Citation\":2190,\"Url\":\"http:\\\/\\\/uweb.deis.unical.it\\\/tagarelli\\\/wp-content\\\/uploads\\\/2011\\\/12\\\/10.1.1.71.15991-2.pdf\",\"Abstract\":{\"Content\":\"A Survey of Clustering Data Mining Techniques 3 used for data compression in image processing, which is also known as vec-tor quantization [89].\"},\"Caption\":{\"Content\":\"A Survey of Clustering Data Mining Techniques 3 used for data compression in image processing, which is also known as vec-tor quantization [89].\"},\"Sources\":[{\"Url\":\"http:\\\/\\\/uweb.deis.unical.it\\\/tagarelli\\\/wp-content\\\/uploads\\\/2011\\\/12\\\/10.1.1.71.15991-2.pdf\"}]},{\"Id\":1996869586,\"Title\":{\"OriginalTitle\":\"Data Preparation for Mining World Wide Web Browsing Patterns\",\"NormalizedTitle\":\"Data Preparation for Mining World Wide Web Browsing Patterns\"},\"PublishYear\":2013,\"Venue\":{\"OriginalVenue\":\"Knowledge and Information Systems\",\"NormalizedVenue\":\"Knowledge and Information Systems\",\"DOI\":\"1\"},\"Authors\":[{\"Id\":2117479945,\"Name\":\"Robert Cooley\"},{\"Id\":1892801027,\"Name\":\"Bamshad Mobasher\"},{\"Id\":2192802387,\"Name\":\"Jaideep Srivastava\"}],\"Affiliations\":[{\"Id\":130238516,\"Name\":\"University of Minnesota\"}],\"FieldsOfStudies\":[{\"Id\":136764020,\"Name\":\"World Wide Web\"},{\"Id\":197046077,\"Name\":\"Web mining\"},{\"Id\":193524817,\"Name\":\"Association rule learning\"},{\"Id\":133462117,\"Name\":\"Data collection\"},{\"Id\":124101348,\"Name\":\"Data mining\"}],\"Citation\":2114,\"Url\":\"http:\\\/\\\/dmr.cs.umn.edu\\\/papers\\\/p1999_14.pdf\",\"Abstract\":{\"Content\":\"Data Preparation for Mining World Wide Web Browsing Patterns Robert Cooley?, Bamshad Mobasher, and Jaideep Srivastava Department of Computer Science and Engineering\"},\"Caption\":{\"Content\":\"Data Preparation for Mining World Wide Web Browsing Patterns Robert Cooley?, Bamshad Mobasher, and Jaideep Srivastava Department of Computer Science and Engineering\"},\"Sources\":[{\"Url\":\"http:\\\/\\\/dmr.cs.umn.edu\\\/papers\\\/p1999_14.pdf\"}]},{\"Id\":1996869586,\"Title\":{\"OriginalTitle\":\"Data Preparation for Mining World Wide Web Browsing Patterns\",\"NormalizedTitle\":\"Data Preparation for Mining World Wide Web Browsing Patterns\"},\"PublishYear\":2013,\"Venue\":{\"OriginalVenue\":\"Knowledge and Information Systems\",\"NormalizedVenue\":\"Knowledge and Information Systems\",\"DOI\":\"1\"},\"Authors\":[{\"Id\":2117479945,\"Name\":\"Robert Cooley\"},{\"Id\":1892801027,\"Name\":\"Bamshad Mobasher\"},{\"Id\":2192802387,\"Name\":\"Jaideep Srivastava\"}],\"Affiliations\":[{\"Id\":130238516,\"Name\":\"University of Minnesota\"}],\"FieldsOfStudies\":[{\"Id\":136764020,\"Name\":\"World Wide Web\"},{\"Id\":197046077,\"Name\":\"Web mining\"},{\"Id\":193524817,\"Name\":\"Association rule learning\"},{\"Id\":133462117,\"Name\":\"Data collection\"},{\"Id\":124101348,\"Name\":\"Data mining\"}],\"Citation\":2114,\"Url\":\"http:\\\/\\\/facweb.cs.depaul.edu\\\/mobasher\\\/classes\\\/ect584\\\/papers\\\/cms-kais.pdf\",\"Abstract\":{\"Content\":\"As the examples above show, mining for knowledge from Web log data has the potential ofrevealing information ofgreat value.

Each of these systems has different data source and objectives for knowledge discovering. After preprocessing the available data in each case, data mining techniques can be applied: statistics and visualization; clustering, classification and outlier detection; association rule mining and pattern mining; and text mining. The success of the plentiful work needs much more specialized work in order for educational data mining to become a mature area.\"},\"Sources\":[{\"Url\":\"http:\\\/\\\/www.sciencedirect.com\\\/science\\\/article\\\/pii\\\/s0957417406001266\"}]},{\"Id\":2043606064,\"Title\":{\"OriginalTitle\":\"Uniqueness of medical data mining\",\"NormalizedTitle\":\"Uniqueness of medical data mining\"},\"PublishYear\":2002,\"Venue\":{\"OriginalVenue\":\"Artificial Intelligence in Medicine\",\"NormalizedVenue\":\"Artificial Intelligence in Medicine\",\"DOI\":\"1\"},\"Authors\":[{\"Id\":2010675024,\"Name\":\"Krzysztof J Cios\"},{\"Name\":\"G William Moore\"}],\"Affiliations\":[{\"Id\":921990950,\"Name\":\"University of Colorado Denver\"},{\"Id\":126744593,\"Name\":\"University of Maryland Baltimore\"}],\"FieldsOfStudies\":[{\"Id\":120567893,\"Name\":\"Knowledge extraction\"},{\"Id\":124101348,\"Name\":\"Data mining\"}],\"Citation\":535,\"Url\":\"http:\\\/\\\/www.cs.uwm.edu\\\/~mani\\\/fall05\\\/smi\\\/link\\\/pdf\\\/aimj-medkdd1.pdf\",\"Abstract\":{\"Content\":\"This article addresses the special features of data mining with medical data.

(3) How do privacy concerns raised by data mining differ from those concerns introduced by ’traditional‘ information-retrieval techniques in computer databases? (4) How do privacy concerns raised by mining personal data from the Internet differ from those concerns introduced by mining such data from ’data warehouses?‘ It is argued that the practice of using data-mining techniques, whether on the Internet or in data warehouses, to gain information about persons raises privacy concerns that (a) go beyond concerns introduced in traditional information-retrieval techniques in computer databases and (b) are not covered by present data-protection guidelines and privacy laws.\"},\"Sources\":[{\"Url\":\"https:\\\/\\\/www.deepdyve.com\\\/lp\\\/springer-journals\\\/informational-privacy-data-mining-and-the-internet-okrl0bydev\"}]},{\"Id\":2046310563,\"Title\":{\"OriginalTitle\":\"Social area analysis, data mining, and GIS\",\"NormalizedTitle\":\"Social area analysis, data mining, and GIS\"},\"PublishYear\":2008,\"Venue\":{\"OriginalVenue\":\"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems\",\"NormalizedVenue\":\"Computers, Environment and Urban Systems\",\"DOI\":\"1\"},\"Authors\":[{\"Id\":2127059029,\"Name\":\"Seth E Spielman\"},{\"Id\":2070851252,\"Name\":\"Jeanclaude Thill\"}],\"Affiliations\":[{\"Id\":63190737,\"Name\":\"University at Buffalo\"},{\"Id\":102149020,\"Name\":\"University of North Carolina at Charlotte\"}],\"FieldsOfStudies\":[{\"Id\":161584116,\"Name\":\"Multivariate statistics\"},{\"Id\":206278253,\"Name\":\"Geodemography\"},{\"Id\":111168008,\"Name\":\"Self-organizing map\"},{\"Id\":124101348,\"Name\":\"Data mining\"},{\"Id\":12780434,\"Name\":\"Geomatics\"}],\"Citation\":37,\"Url\":\"http:\\\/\\\/www.sciencedirect.com\\\/science\\\/article\\\/pii\\\/s0198971507000907\",\"Abstract\":{\"Content\":\"There is a long cartographic tradition of describing cities through a focus on the characteristics of their residents.
